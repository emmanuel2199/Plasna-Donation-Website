                <p>Why?</p>
                <p>Quite simply, plasma donors are needed because lives depend on plasma protein therapies. Donating
                    plasma is often called, "the gift of life." Only a small number of people living in the U.S. who are
                    eligible to donate blood or source
                    plasma actually donate. The plasma protein therapeutics industry supports donation in all of its
                    forms, so that donors may contribute live-saving blood and source plasma to those in need Source
                    plasma donation and blood donation
                    are critically important activities that contribute to saving lives. For many with rare diseases,
                    these are the only therapies available to treat these chronic conditions. Your plasma will be used
                    to create therapies that treat
                    a variety of conditions and diseases. Below is a brief description of the types of plasma protein
                    therapies that are manufactured from source plasma and the types of conditions they are used to
                    treat.</p>

                <h2>PLASMA DONATION FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS</h2>

                <img src="images/3.jpg" alt="blog " />

                <p>With the number of people affected by COVID-19 infection during the second wave only increasing by
                    the day, the demand for the plasma of recovered patients has also gone up tremendously. However,
                    many people still have some inhibitions
                    about donating plasma thinking it might make them more susceptible to the infection once again. But
                    that’s a myth and donating plasma can save lives, stress experts.<br> “The antibodies, which are
                    present in your body, can help
                    someone fight the infection and emerge victorious. If your COVID symptoms have been absent for more
                    than 14 days, kindly consider donating as a service to humanity. Just like during any regular blood
                    donation session, plasma will
                    be drawn from your arm,” said Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder and director, Ujala Cygnus Group of
                    Hospitals.

                <p>Clotting Factors—People with bleeding disorders are unable to clot blood properly. As a result a
                    minor injury may result in internal bleeding, organ damage and even.<br> Immunoglobulin or
                    IVIG—There are more than 150 primary immune
                    deficiency disorders (PID). These individuals have improperly functioning immune systems and do not
                    respond to traditional antibiotics. Without IVIG, they are exposed to frequent and often serious
                    infections.<br> Alpha-1 Antitrypsin—Alpha-1
                    is more commonly known as genetic emphysema. It is a heredity condition that may result in serious
                    lung disease in adults and lung and/or liver disease in both children and adults.<br>
                    Albumin—Albumin is used to treat burns, trauma
                    patients and surgical patients.<br> Hyperimmuneglobulins—These are used to treat rabies, tetanus,
                    dialysis patients and organ transplant recipients. They are also used to treat pregnant women who
                    have Rh incompatibility, a condition
                    where the mother and fetus have incompatible blood that can lead to serious injury to the unborn
                    child or even death.</p>
